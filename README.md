### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market condition remains cautious with most major assets and indices trading below their SMA20, signaling bearish or consolidating conditions. Wall Street equities (AAPL, MSFT, SPY, QQQ, NVDA, GLD) are currently closed (CERRADO), preventing any active trading on traditional stocks. In the crypto sector, assets like ETH-USD and BTC-USD show slight positive 24h performance, but their trend remains strictly bearish below the SMA20, failing our strict trend-following pullback rules. Our existing AAPL position is slightly negative (-0.73%) but maintains an uptrend status above the SMA20, adhering to equity holding patience guidelines."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and is currently holding steady despite temporary flatness. Following equity holding patience guidelines, we give the position time to play out without panicking over minor drawdowns, keeping a strict stop-loss in place.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain AAPL position patiently as it is in an uptrend above the SMA20. Monitor stop-loss around -2.0% and target a +3.5% to +5.0% profit objective upon market reopening. Avoid all crypto assets because they remain in downtrends below the SMA20, violating our strict trend filter. Preserve cash reserves ($32.23 USD) and await high-quality pullbacks in confirmed uptrend assets when markets reopen."
