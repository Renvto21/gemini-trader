### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market continues to experience a defensive posture with most major equities and assets remaining closed and trading below their SMA20 trends. AAPL is our sole open position, currently showing a modest negative return (-0.73%) well within our stop-loss thresholds while maintaining its bullish trend status above the SMA20. Crypto markets are open but remain trapped in broader bearish trends below the SMA20, meaning no crypto positions will be opened in compliance with strict trend-following filters. We maintain our capital preservation stance, holding AAPL in accordance with equity holding patience rules."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL remains in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20. Per equity holding patience rules, we maintain the position while monitoring the stop-loss level and targeting a profit window between +3.0% and +5.0%.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL position as it remains in an uptrend above the SMA20 and has not hit the stop-loss level (~339.80 USD). Profit target remains set between +3.0% and +5.0% (357.00 - 364.00 USD). Keep all crypto assets sidelined since they are trading below their SMA20 trend lines. Await market reopening for equities to seek new pullback entries following strict quantitative rules."
