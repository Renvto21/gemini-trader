### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market is currently constrained with Wall Street assets closed (status CERRADO). Among the major crypto assets, BTC, ETH, and SOL are all trading below their SMA20, signaling bearish trends that keep them ineligible for purchase per our strict trend filter. AAPL remains our sole active holding, currently exhibiting a positive price action (+0.16% PnL, price 347.73) with its market status closed. Following equity patience rules, we maintain AAPL as it is in a structural uptrend above its SMA20 and has not hit stop-loss or take-profit thresholds."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is currently in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 with a positive PnL (+0.16%). Following our equity holding patience rule, we do not rotate or sell an equity position just because it has been flat for a short duration; we hold until take-profit targets or stop-loss limits are reached.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL within its structural uptrend above the SMA20, giving it time to play out while monitoring for take-profit criteria (+3.0% to +5.0% gain or 1-hour RSI above 72) and adhering strictly to the -1.8% to -2.0% stop-loss threshold. Keep all crypto assets sidelined as they remain below their SMA20. Maintain cash reserves above $4.00 USD."
