### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street is currently closed (market_status: CERRADO), holding equity positions AAPL, MSFT, and GLD in a frozen state while maintaining patient posture in accordance with equity holding rules. All three positions remain above their SMA20 trends with mild unrealized gains. Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL) are trading 24/7 but remain in strict bear trends (below SMA20) with negative 1-hour changes, failing to meet the strict quantitative reversal trigger (rsi_1h >= 32 and change_1h_pct > 0.0), keeping us cleanly out of crypto asset exposure."

**Cycle Actions:**
- *No changes this cycle (HOLD)*

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain existing patience on AAPL, MSFT, and GLD as they rest during weekend market hours. Continue to monitor for take-profit triggers (+3.0% to +5.0%) or stop-loss limits (-1.8% to -2.0%) upon Wall Street reopening. Avoid all crypto assets as downtrends and lack of positive 1-hour momentum violate core trend-following rules."
