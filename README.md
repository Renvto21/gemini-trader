### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Major equity markets are closed with prices frozen, and most equities along with crypto assets remain under pressure or below their respective SMA20 trends. AAPL is our sole remaining open equity position, currently holding a modest gain (+0.5%) while remaining in a confirmed bullish trend above its SMA20. In the crypto sector, assets like SOL-USD, BTC-USD, and ETH-USD are currently trading below the SMA20 trend filter, with crypto market hours active (24/7). Although SOL-USD shows a minor 1-hour bounce, its daily trend is bearish and RSI indicators across the board do not yet warrant entry under our strict trend-following pullback rules. We adhere to patient holding for equity positions and disciplined risk management."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 80%): AAPL remains in a confirmed uptrend above the SMA20 with a positive PnL (+0.5%). Per equity holding patience rules, we do not rotate or sell prematurely and continue holding toward our +3.0% to +5.0% take-profit target.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL patiently as it remains above the SMA20 in an uptrend, targeting a take-profit between +3.0% and +5.0% and maintaining stop-loss discipline near -1.8%. Avoid opening new crypto positions until clear uptrend confirmation and structural pullbacks form. Monitor equity markets upon reopening for new trend opportunities."
