### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The broader market remains largely under pressure with most equities and crypto assets trading below their respective SMA20 trend filters, signaling a persistent bearish macro environment. AAPL continues to be a resilient outlier, maintaining its position in a confirmed uptrend above the SMA20 with solid daily momentum. Other assets either reside below their SMA20 or lack the necessary reversal triggers to justify entry."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL remains in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 with positive performance. Complying with the equity holding patience rule, we continue holding to let the winning position run toward our profit target without premature rotation.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "We are maintaining our AAPL position with current PnL around +0.72% following equity holding patience rules. Target profit remains between +3.0% and +5.0% ($357.50 to $364.50) or an RSI 1H exceeding 72. Stop-loss remains protected near the -2.0% circuit breaker. No new positions will be opened until assets currently in a downtrend reclaim their SMA20 and fulfill our reversal confirmation triggers."
