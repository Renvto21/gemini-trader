### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The US equity markets and gold are currently closed with frozen prices. In the equity space, AAPL and MSFT remain held as they are in confirmed uptrends above their SMA20, adhering to the patience rule for equities despite flat short-term action. Other major indices and assets like QQQ, SPY, NVDA, and GLD are currently below their SMA20 (downtrend). In the crypto sector, although BTC-USD, SOL-USD, and ETH-USD are open 24/7, all of them are currently in a downtrend (below their SMA20), which triggers our strict trend filter preventing any crypto buys."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): AAPL remains in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20. Following the equity holding patience rule, we continue to hold the position as no stop-loss or profit target has been reached.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain existing holdings in AAPL and MSFT as both are in confirmed uptrends. Patiently hold them until profit targets (+3.0% to +5.0%) or stop-loss limits (-1.8%) are met upon equity market re-opening. Avoid crypto assets entirely due to ongoing downtrends below the SMA20."
