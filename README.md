### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market is currently in a defensive posture with most major equities and crypto assets trading below their SMA20 lines. AAPL remains our sole active holding, demonstrating relative strength by staying above its SMA20 with an uptrend and a daily RSI of 72.3. Wall Street markets are closed (CERRADO), meaning no new equity positions can be executed. Crypto assets are open 24/7, but all major tokens (ETH, SOL, BTC) are in downtrends below the SMA20, failing our strict trend filter. Therefore, we maintain our current position in AAPL while adhering to equity holding patience rules."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is maintaining its uptrend above the SMA20. Following equity holding patience rules, we hold the position as it is flat/slightly positive (+0.16%) and approaching take-profit territory without hitting stop-loss thresholds. Wall Street is currently closed.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL based on equity patience rules. Current PnL is +0.16% with 1h RSI at 66.0. Monitor for take-profit criteria if 1h RSI exceeds 72 or total gains reach +3.0% to +5.0%. Keep crypto assets sidelined due to bearish trends below the SMA20."
