### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The broader market remains locked in a macro downtrend across all monitored equities and cryptocurrencies, with every single asset currently trading below its SMA20. Wall Street assets are closed (CERRADO) and feature frozen prices, while crypto assets (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD) are open 24/7 but fail the stringent quantitative trend and momentum filters. Specifically, ETH-USD and SOL-USD are in bearish trends with RSI values below 32 and lack confirmed positive 1-hour momentum candles required for safe entry. Capital preservation is prioritized, and cash reserves are successfully maintained at $39.09."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] BTC-USD** (Confidence: 100%): Asset is currently below the SMA20 trend line and lacks a confirmed reversal trigger (rsi_1h is below 32 and change_1h_pct is insufficient). Capital preservation dictates staying in cash until a proper bull trend is confirmed.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintained defensive cash position ($39.09) as all available assets fail the SMA20 trend filter and lack confirmed reversal triggers (rsi_1h >= 32 and change_1h_pct > 0.0). Will continue to hold cash until assets break back above their SMA20 lines and establish high-quality pullback entries. Do not catch falling knives."
