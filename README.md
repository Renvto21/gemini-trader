### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street markets are currently closed (CERRADO), leaving stock and ETF prices frozen with most major indices trading below their SMA20 trend lines in a broader macro correction context. Cryptocurrencies remain active 24/7, but major assets like BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and SOL-USD are also currently in bearish trends (below SMA20) and lack the clean reversal confirmation required by our strict pullback rules. Our existing equity holding AAPL is closed for the weekend but continues to show strong resilience, sitting at a +2.98% PnL close to our take-profit target zone while maintaining its position above the SMA20 uptrend filter."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and is currently up +2.98%, nearing our profit target. Adhering to the equity holding patience rule, we continue to hold while markets are closed, awaiting a take-profit opportunity upon market reopening.

---

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL under the equity holding patience rule. Monitor AAPL closely when markets reopen for a take-profit execution if it crosses the +3.0% to +5.0% target or if rsi_1h surpasses 72. Maintain strict stop-loss discipline at -2.0%. Refrain from opening new crypto positions as current available crypto assets are in downtrends below their SMA20 lines, violating our rule against catching falling knives."
