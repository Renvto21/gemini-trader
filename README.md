### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street equities (AAPL, NVDA, SPY, QQQ, MSFT, GLD) are currently closed, with prices frozen. AAPL remains our sole active equity holding, displaying a mild unrealized loss (-0.73%) but maintaining its position above the SMA20 trend filter. Crypto assets are trading 24/7, but none currently satisfy our strict reversal trigger and uptrend confirmation simultaneously: BTC-USD is below its SMA20 despite a positive 1-hour change, and SOL-USD shows a negative 1-hour percentage change. Capital preservation and patience remain paramount."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and is currently holding steady despite temporary market consolidation. Per equity holding patience rules, we do not exit positions simply for being flat and will let the trade play out above our strict stop-loss level.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain patience with the existing AAPL position, respecting the strict stop-loss threshold near $338.00 and monitoring for a recovery toward profit targets above $360.00. Keep cash reserves secure ($32.23) and wait for Wall Street markets to reopen before seeking additional equity setups. Do not enter crypto unless a confirmed uptrend and positive 1-hour bounce trigger align perfectly."
