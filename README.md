### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street equities are currently closed with prices frozen, showing broad short-term weakness across major indices (NVDA, SPY, QQQ, GLD, MSFT) which remain below their SMA20 trend filters. AAPL is holding up relatively well, remaining in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 despite a mild -0.73% unrealized PnL. In the crypto markets, assets like SOL-USD and ETH-USD are trading 24/7 but remain firmly in bearish macro trends below their SMA20 lines, preventing any new crypto buys under our strict trend-following pullback rules. Cash reserves are robust at $32.23."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL is currently in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20. Per equity holding patience rules, we maintain the position despite minor fluctuations, giving it time to play out while monitoring for the +3.0% to +5.0% take-profit target or the -1.8% to -2.0% stop-loss threshold.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain AAPL under equity holding patience rules since it remains in an uptrend above the SMA20. Monitor AAPL for take-profit targets between +3.0% and +5.0% or execute a strict stop-loss if it drops past -1.8% to -2.0%. Keep all crypto assets sidelined due to bearish trends below SMA20. Wait for Wall Street markets to reopen before evaluating new equity setups."
