### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Traditional markets are currently closed (CERRADO) with prices frozen, meaning equity positions such as AAPL and MSFT must be held patiently in accordance with equity holding rules. Both AAPL and MSFT remain in confirmed uptrends above their SMA20. In the crypto sector (ABIERTO 24/7), assets like BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and SOL-USD continue to trade in bearish trends below their SMA20 despite brief green 1-hour candles. Strict trend filters and anti-correlation constraints prevent crypto entry at this time, as we avoid catching falling knives."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): Asset is in a confirmed uptrend above SMA20 with market status closed. Patiently holding per equity patience rules while targeting +3.0% to +5.0% profit.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain existing equity positions AAPL and MSFT through market closure, watching for profit-taking targets between +3.0% and +5.0% or stop-loss triggers at -2.0%. Keep crypto sidelined due to persistent macro downtrends below the SMA20. Wait for traditional market reopening or confirmed breakout structures before allocating additional cash reserves."
