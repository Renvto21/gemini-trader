### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street equities (AAPL, MSFT, SPY, QQQ, NVDA, GLD) are currently closed ('CERRADO'), with prices frozen and major indices trading below their respective SMA20 lines. Cryptocurrencies are open 24/7; however, all tracked crypto assets (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD) remain below their SMA20 trend filters, signaling prevailing bearish macro conditions. Adhering strictly to the quantitative rules, no new crypto entries are permitted since none present a confirmed uptrend above the SMA20, and existing equity positions must be held through the weekend per patience rules as long as stop-loss limits are not breached."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): Market status is closed ('CERRADO'), and equity holding patience rule dictates maintaining positions unless stop-loss is hit. Current drawdown is within normal tactical tolerance.
- **[HOLD] MSFT** (Confidence: 100%): Market status is closed ('CERRADO'), and equity holding patience rule dictates maintaining positions unless stop-loss is hit. Current drawdown is well above the hard circuit breaker limit.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Holding AAPL and MSFT positions through the weekend as per equity patience guidelines. Monitor price action closely upon Monday's Wall Street market re-opening. Check stop-loss levels (-2.0%) and do not initiate any new crypto trades unless an asset clearly reclaims its SMA20 with positive momentum."
