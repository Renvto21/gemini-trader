### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market condition remains cautious, with major US equities and indices closed (market status CERRADO) and trading below their respective 20-day simple moving averages (BAJISTA trend), signaling a weak macro environment. Cryptocurrencies like BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and SOL-USD are currently open (24/7) but are also trading below their SMA20 with neutral-to-negative short-term momentum (1-hour changes slightly negative). AAPL remains our sole active equity position, holding steady in a confirmed uptrend above the SMA20 with a positive PnL (+0.5%), adhering strictly to the equity holding patience rule."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and currently showing a modest positive gain (+0.5%). Per equity holding patience rules, stocks should not be rotated or sold just for being flat over several days unless take-profit targets or stop-losses are triggered.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL patiently as per equity holding rules since it remains in an uptrend above the SMA20. Maintain take-profit targets between $357 and $364 (+3.0% to +5.0%) and preserve strict stop-loss protection at -1.8%. Avoid opening new positions in closed equities or crypto assets as they do not currently meet our trend and bounce confirmation criteria (no positive 1-hour candle or trading below SMA20). Keep cash reserves safely above the $4.00 minimum."
