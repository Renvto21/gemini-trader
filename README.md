### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market is experiencing a defensive posture with major equities and crypto assets trading below their SMA20 lines, indicating widespread bearish macro sentiment or consolidation. Wall Street assets (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, SPY, QQQ, GLD) are currently closed. AAPL remains our sole active position, holding a modest profit of +0.5% while adhering to our equity holding patience rule. Cryptocurrencies are open 24/7, but most are in downtrends below the SMA20, meaning we must refrain from taking crypto positions until strict trend-following pullback criteria are met."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL is currently in a confirmed uptrend above the SMA20 with a positive PnL of +0.5%. Following our equity holding patience rule, we will not sell prematurely and will let the position develop toward our +3.0% to +5.0% profit target while monitoring the stop-loss.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL patiently as it remains above the SMA20 in an uptrend, targeting take-profit between +3.0% and +5.0% and respecting the hard stop-loss at -1.8%. Avoid opening any new cryptocurrency positions as they remain below their SMA20s and do not meet our reversal confirmation triggers. Wait for market reopening and high-quality setup confirmations."
