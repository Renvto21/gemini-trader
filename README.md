### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The Wall Street equity markets are currently closed (CERRADO), so prices are frozen and no equity orders can be executed. Both of our current holdings, AAPL and MSFT, remain in an active uptrend above their SMA20, respecting our strict trend filter. Although crypto assets are open 24/7, all major options (BTC, ETH, SOL) are currently in a bearish trend below their SMA20, violating our core quantitative trend filter rule against catching falling knives. Therefore, maintaining patience with our equity positions and keeping cash reserves untouched is the optimal strategy."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): Asset is in an uptrend above SMA20 and market is currently closed. Holding per equity patience guidelines.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Hold AAPL and MSFT through market closure. Monitor equity prices when Wall Street reopens, targeting +3.0% to +5.0% for take-profit or cutting strictly if stop-loss reaches -1.8%. Continue to avoid crypto assets as long as they remain below their SMA20 trend lines."
