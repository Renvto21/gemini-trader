### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market continues to digest sharp macroeconomic pulldowns, with Wall Street currently closed and major indices like SPY, QQQ, and NVDA trading in confirmed downtrends below their SMA20. Crypto assets are open 24/7 but remain weak, trading below their SMA20 with low 1-hour RSI values and negative momentum, failing our reversal criteria. Our sole open position, AAPL, is in a confirmed uptrend (above SMA20) and is currently closed for trading, showing stable resilience despite broader tech sector volatility."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20. The market is currently closed, and equities require patience and time to play out rather than premature rotation. Holding the current position while monitoring stop-loss and take-profit targets.

---

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL patiently while markets are closed, monitoring for a take-profit target between +3.0% and +5.0% or a stop-loss trigger at -1.8% to -2.0% upon market reopening. Keep all crypto and downtrend assets excluded due to strict trend filters and lack of positive 1-hour reversal momentum. Maintain capital preservation and cash reserves above the $4.00 minimum."
