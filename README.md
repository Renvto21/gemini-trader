### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "All traditional equities and ETF markets (QQQ, GLD, NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, SPY) are currently closed (CERRADO), precluding any active stock trading. Cryptocurrencies are open (24/7). BTC-USD and ETH-USD are in confirmed uptrends (above SMA20) with strong 24h momentum, though their 1h candles show slight negative changes (-0.02% and -0.03%) and 1h RSIs are slightly elevated near 75-76. SOL-USD is currently in a downtrend (below SMA20). Following strict rules, we must wait for a clear green 1h candle confirmation (>0.0%) and RSI cooling before opening a crypto position."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] BTC-USD** (Confidence: 80%): Asset is in an uptrend above SMA20, but the current 1h candle change is slightly negative (-0.02%) and RSI is elevated at 75.9. Waiting for a proper pullback confirmation and green 1h candle before entry.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

Maintain patience, avoid catching falling knives, and wait for a confirmed green 1h candle and a healthy pullback before deploying capital into a single crypto position."
