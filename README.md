### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Equity markets and traditional assets are currently closed with frozen prices. AAPL remains our sole active position, trading in a confirmed uptrend above the SMA20 with a current PnL of +0.16% and a 1H RSI of 66.0. All other equity assets (MSFT, QQQ, SPY, GLD, NVDA) are in a downtrend below the SMA20. Cryptocurrency assets are open (24/7), but BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and SOL-USD are all currently in a downtrend below the SMA20 with negative 1H price changes, failing our strict trend filter and reversal confirmation rules. Therefore, we hold our position in AAPL patiently."

**Cycle Actions:**
- *No changes this cycle (HOLD)*

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL patiently as it remains in an uptrend above the SMA20. Monitor AAPL upon market reopening for take-profit execution (+3.0% to +5.0% gain or 1H RSI > 72) or strict stop-loss protection (-1.8% to -2.0%). Keep all crypto assets sidelined as they do not meet the strict trend filter requirements. Maintain cash reserves above $4.00 USD."
