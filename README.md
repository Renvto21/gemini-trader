### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The broader market is exhibiting weakness, with major equity indices like QQQ, SPY, NVDA, and MSFT trading below their SMA20 lines in bearish trends alongside weak 1-hour momentum. AAPL is the notable exception, maintaining a confirmed bullish trend above its SMA20 with stable daily and hourly RSI levels, currently up slightly despite intraday headwinds. Cryptocurrencies remain under heavy pressure with all major assets currently in bearish trends below their respective SMA20 lines, failing to offer viable pullback entry setups."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL remains in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20. In accordance with equity holding patience guidelines, we continue to hold through flat intraday movement while monitoring our take-profit and stop-loss targets.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding our AAPL position patiently as it remains above its SMA20 in line with equity holding patience guidelines. Watch for our take-profit target between +3.0% and +5.0% ($357.50 to $364.50) or a stop-loss trigger at -1.8%. No crypto or new equity trades will be initiated until stricter reversal confirmations and uptrend conditions are met across candidate assets."
