### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The equity markets (AAPL and MSFT) are currently closed (market status: CERRADO), and both positions remain stable in confirmed uptrends above the SMA20. Per equity holding patience rules, we maintain these positions and do not execute any sales or rotations while they stay within normal consolidation bands. Cryptocurrencies are open (24/7) but remain in downtrends below their respective SMA20 levels with negative 7-day trajectories, failing our strict trend filter and reversal confirmation triggers. Therefore, no new crypto trades are initiated."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): Asset is in a closed market state and holding steady above SMA20 within an uptrend. Upholding equity holding patience.
- **[HOLD] MSFT** (Confidence: 100%): Asset is in a closed market state and maintaining position above SMA20. Upholding equity holding patience.
