### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The market remains predominantly in a defensive posture with most equities and cryptos trading below their SMA20, signaling a broader downtrend or consolidation phase. AAPL is the sole asset maintaining a confirmed bullish trend above its SMA20 and currently shows an 1-hour RSI of 66.0, approaching our take-profit zone (+3% to +5% gain or rsi_1h > 72). Wall Street markets are closed (CERRADO), meaning no equity trading can occur. Cryptocurrencies are open (24/7) but all major cryptos (SOL-USD, ETH-USD, BTC-USD) are in bearish trends below their SMA20, failing our strict trend filter."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is currently in a confirmed uptrend above SMA20 with a positive PnL and an rsi_1h of 66.0. Following equity holding patience guidelines, we will maintain the position while awaiting the take-profit target of +3% to +5% or rsi_1h > 72.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding the AAPL position as it adheres to the equity holding patience rule and remains in a confirmed uptrend above the SMA20. Monitor rsi_1h closely for a take-profit execution once it crosses 72 with a +3% to +5% return, and maintain the hard -1.8% stop-loss. Keep all crypto assets sidelined as they violate the uptrend rule."
