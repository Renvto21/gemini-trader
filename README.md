### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market condition remains cautious, with major US equities and cryptocurrencies trading mostly under their respective SMA20 lines, indicating broader macro weakness. AAPL is the sole asset maintaining a confirmed uptrend (above SMA20) with a daily RSI of 66.5, currently showing a modest profit of +0.5%. Wall Street markets are closed, freezing prices for equities, while crypto markets are open with BTC-USD and others attempting minor bounces. However, crypto assets remain in downtrends below their SMA20, failing our strict trend-filtering rules."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL remains in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and is currently up +0.5%. In accordance with equity holding patience rules, we maintain the position while monitoring for our target take-Profit range of +3.0% to +5.0% and safeguarding against the -1.8% stop-loss.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL patiently as per equity holding rules since it remains in an uptrend above the SMA20, with current unrealized PnL at +0.5%. Maintain our take-profit target between +3.0% and +5.0% ($357.50 to $364.50) and preserve stop-loss protection at -1.8%. Avoid opening new positions in closed equities and do not enter crypto assets because they remain in bearish trends below the SMA20, despite short-term bounce attempts. Keep cash reserves safely above the $4.00 minimum."
