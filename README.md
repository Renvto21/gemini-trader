### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Traditional equity markets remain closed with prices frozen, and most major indices and stocks (QQQ, SPY, NVDA, GLD, MSFT) are currently in downtrends below their SMA20. AAPL remains our sole active equity holding, currently showing resilience in an uptrend above its SMA20 with a modest -0.73% PnL, well clear of our -1.8% to -2.0% stop-loss threshold. In the crypto sector, all available assets (ETH-USD, SOL-USD, BTC-USD) are currently in bearish trends below the SMA20, meaning they fail our strict trend filter despite open 24/7 market status. Following equity holding patience rules, we will maintain AAPL and hold cash."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL is maintaining its position above the SMA20 trend line and is currently down only -0.73%, well above our -2.0% stop-loss threshold. In accordance with equity holding patience guidelines, flat or minor drawdowns do not warrant selling unless a stop-loss is breached.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL patiently within its current uptrend above SMA20. Monitor stop-loss around -1.8% to -2.0% and take-profit targets between +3.0% and +5.0%. Keep crypto sidelined as all available digital assets remain in downtrends below the SMA20. Await traditional market re-opening to scan for new high-quality equity pullback opportunities."
