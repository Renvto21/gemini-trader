### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market presents mixed conditions with traditional equities currently closed for trading (market status: CERRADO). AAPL remains in our portfolio in an uptrend above its SMA20, currently exhibiting a minor unrealized loss of -0.96%, well within our acceptable risk limits and far from the stop-loss trigger. Crypto assets are open for 24/7 trading but remain in bearish trends below their respective SMA20 levels, meaning we maintain a strict hands-off approach due to our trend-filtering rules."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is still in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20. Per equity holding patience rules, we do not rotate out of flat or minorly negative positions during market closures unless the strict stop-loss of -1.8% to -2.0% is breached.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL through the market closure, watching for a recovery toward our +3.0% to +5.0% take-profit goal or defending the position if it approaches the strict -1.8% to -2.0% stop-loss threshold upon market reopening. Keep crypto exposure at zero since all coins are trading below the SMA20. Maintain cash reserves safely above $4.00 USD."
