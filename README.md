### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The broader equity market and major cryptocurrencies are experiencing severe downside pressure, with Wall Street posting significant losses and crypto assets falling sharply following macro and post-election volatility. Most assets remain in a confirmed downtrend below their SMA20, signaling falling knife conditions. However, our sole open position, AAPL, remains in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 with neutral-to-bullish daily indicators. Because the stock market is currently closed, AAPL prices are frozen, and equity holding patience dictates keeping the position open. Cryptocurrencies are open 24/7, but none meet our strict entry filter of being in an uptrend with positive 1-hour momentum, so no new crypto positions are initiated."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and the market is currently closed. Adhering to equity holding patience, we maintain the position without premature selling while monitoring stop-loss and profit targets for the upcoming market open.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain the current AAPL position patiently through the market closure. Watch for profit target between +3.0% and +5.0% once markets reopen, while maintaining strict stop-loss protection between -1.8% and -2.0%. Keep all crypto assets excluded due to persistent downtrends below SMA20 and lack of reversal confirmation. Cash reserves remain well above the $4.00 minimum at $32.14."
