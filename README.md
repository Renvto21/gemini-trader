### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street markets remain closed (CERRADO) for the weekend, with asset prices and indicators frozen. Consequently, no equity trades can be executed. Current holdings AAPL and MSFT remain stable above their SMA20 trend lines and well within acceptable risk parameters, meaning we maintain equity holding patience per rules. Cryptocurrencies are open (24/7) but continue to trade in strong bear trends below their SMA20 thresholds, with negative momentum preventing any buy signals according to our strict trend filter and reversal confirmation triggers."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): Asset is in a confirmed uptrend above SMA20 and market status is closed. Holding per equity patience rules while monitoring for profit targets.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain patience with equity positions AAPL and MSFT while Wall Street is closed. Monitor for market reopening to evaluate profit targets (+3.0% to +5.0%) and protect capital with a strict -2.0% stop-loss threshold. Keep crypto sidelined due to persistent bear trends."
