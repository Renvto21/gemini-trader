### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "All tracked equities and commodities (AAPL, MSFT, GLD, SPY, QQQ, NVDA) are currently under 'CERRADO' market status, with prices frozen. Furthermore, all available assets are currently trading in a DOWNTREND (below their SMA20). Cryptocurrencies (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD) are open 24/7, but they also remain in a downtrend below the SMA20. In accordance with our core quantitative rules, we strictly avoid catching falling knives or initiating new positions in assets under a bear trend. Existing positions in AAPL, MSFT, and GLD are being held patiently despite minor drawdowns, respecting equity holding patience guidelines as stop-loss limits (-1.8% to -2.0%) have not been breached."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): Maintaining position in accordance with equity holding patience rules. Market is closed and position has not hit the hard stop-loss.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Holding AAPL, MSFT, and GLD. Monitor stop-loss thresholds closely (-1.8% to -2.0%). Keep waiting for equities to reopen and reclaim the SMA20, or for crypto assets to form a confirmed uptrend with positive 1-hour momentum before allocating remaining cash reserves ($18.14 USD)."
