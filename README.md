### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street markets are currently closed (CERRADO), meaning no trades can be executed on equities or ETFs like AAPL or MSFT until the next session. Cryptocurrencies are operating normally on 24/7 markets. Within the crypto space, BTC-USD and ETH-USD are trading in confirmed uptrends above their SMA20. However, both currently exhibit negative 1-hour changes (change_1h_pct < 0), indicating ongoing minor pullbacks. Per quantitative rules, we must wait for a positive 1-hour reversal candle (change_1h_pct > 0) with an RSI >= 32 before entering. Cash reserves are intact at $38.78."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] BTC-USD** (Confidence: 50%): Asset is in an uptrend above SMA20, but the 1-hour change is currently negative (-0.12%). Waiting for a confirmed green 1-hour candle (change_1h_pct > 0) to execute a pullback entry per quantitative rules.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintained capital in cash while monitoring crypto assets. BTC-USD and ETH-USD are above SMA20 but require a green 1-hour reversal candle (change_1h_pct > 0) to trigger a standard pullback entry ($6.00-$7.00 USD). Will continue to enforce strict anti-correlation rules by holding a maximum of one crypto asset at a time once entry triggers are met."
