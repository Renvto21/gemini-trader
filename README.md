### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The broader market and major equities/cryptos are currently under short-term corrective pressure, with most assets trading below their SMA20 trendline. MSFT is currently held in the portfolio with a minor drawdown (-1.29%), well above the -2.0% strict stop-loss threshold. According to our Equity Holding Patience rule, we will maintain the MSFT position and wait for a recovery. AAPL is the only asset currently showing a confirmed bullish trend above SMA20 with an RSI above 72, though it is not currently held. No crypto assets meet our strict criteria since all are in a downtrend below SMA20."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] MSFT** (Confidence: 90%): MSFT is currently experiencing a minor pullback (-1.29%), well within our risk tolerance and above the stop-loss threshold. Per equity patience rules, we maintain the position to let it play out.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain MSFT position following equity patience rules, monitoring stop-loss at -1.8% to -2.0%. Keep cash reserves intact while waiting for proper pullback confirmation (RSI >= 32 and positive 1-hour candle) on assets in verified UPTRENDS."
