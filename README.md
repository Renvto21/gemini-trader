### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street equities and commodities markets are closed (market_status: CERRADO), holding prices static. AAPL continues to trade in a confirmed bull trend above its SMA20 with an impressive 2.98% unrealized PnL, approaching our profit target with a 1-hour RSI near 70.4. Other major equities and gold are currently in downtrends below their respective SMA20 lines. Crypto markets are open (24/7), but BTC, ETH, and SOL are all situated in daily/hourly downtrends below their SMA20 benchmarks and show negative 1-hour momentum changes or lack the required green candle confirmation trigger. Therefore, equity holding patience applies to AAPL, while crypto and other assets remain sidelined."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and is currently up +2.98%. Following equity holding patience and asymmetric reward principles, we will hold the position as it approaches our +3.0% to +5.0% profit target without premature rotation.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain the AAPL position as equity holding patience dictates. Watch for an hourly RSI exceeding 72 or a price move pushing PnL towards the +3.0% to +5.0% target zone for a profitable exit. Keep crypto sidelined due to downtrends and lack of confirmed 1-hour rebound triggers. Preserve cash reserves and strictly respect stop-loss rules."
