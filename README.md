### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street equities (AAPL, MSFT, SPY, QQQ, NVDA, GLD) are currently closed with frozen prices. AAPL and MSFT remain stable in positive territory, with AAPL up +0.98% and MSFT up +0.47%. In the crypto markets, which remain open 24/7, BTC-USD is showing strong bullish momentum but its 1-hour RSI is severely overbought at 86.0, preventing any immediate entry under our pullback rules. ETH-USD and SOL-USD are currently trading below their SMA20, meaning they remain in a downtrend per our strict quantitative rules. Given market closures for equities and a lack of valid pullback setups in active crypto assets, patience and capital preservation are the priorities."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): Equity markets are closed. AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend and showing positive unrealized gains (+0.98%). Following equity holding patience rules, we maintain the position without premature rotation.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain existing AAPL and MSFT equity positions through market closure, keeping stop-loss limits intact at -1.8% and targeting +3.0% to +5.0% gains. For cryptocurrencies, refrain from entering BTC-USD while its 1-hour RSI is overbought (>72); wait for BTC-USD or other crypto assets to form a healthy pullback into the 35-65 RSI range with positive 1-hour confirmation before deploying capital."
