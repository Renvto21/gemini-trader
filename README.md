### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The US equity markets are currently closed (CERRADO), and existing positions in AAPL and MSFT remain stable above their SMA20 trend lines, showing strong structural uptrends despite minor daily fluctuations. In the crypto markets, assets like ETH-USD and SOL-USD are currently trading in a bearish trend below their respective SMA20 lines, failing to meet the strict quantitative reversal trigger criteria (change_1h_pct > 0.0 with RSI >= 32). Consequently, no new trades are executed, and current cash reserves are preserved."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): AAPL is in a confirmed structural uptrend above the SMA20 and market status is closed. Adhering to the equity holding patience rule, holding the position as it remains within normal parameters.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain current equity holdings in AAPL and MSFT as they continue to hold above the SMA20. Avoid all crypto assets due to ongoing bearish trends below the SMA20 and lack of solid reversal confirmation. Keep cash reserves intact ($25.01) and wait for Wall Street markets to reopen before assessing new pullback entries. Monitor stop-loss thresholds strictly at -2.0% and take-profit targets between +3.0% and +5.0%."
