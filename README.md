### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The traditional stock market is currently closed (market_status: CERRADO), holding our positions in AAPL and MSFT stable. MSFT shows strong momentum with an RSI of 80.0 and positive daily gains (+1.54%), trading above its SMA20. AAPL is consolidating nicely above its SMA20 with a mild negative 24h change (-1.1%) and an RSI of 30.4. Crypto assets (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD) remain open 24/7, but all are trading below their SMA20 in a confirmed downtrend, violating our strict trend-following pullback rules. Therefore, no crypto trades are executed, and we maintain our equity positions."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 80%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20. Following equity holding patience guidelines, we maintain the position as it consolidates.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain current holdings AAPL and MSFT during market closure. Monitor MSFT for potential take-profit execution (+3.0% to +5.0% target) once the market reopens, given its elevated 1H RSI of 80.0. Exercise patience with AAPL as it consolidates above the SMA20. Continue to avoid crypto due to prevailing downtrends below the SMA20."
