### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market continues to experience broad weakness, with most major equities and cryptocurrencies trading below their respective SMA20 lines in a bearish trend context. Wall Street markets (AAPL, MSFT, SPY, QQQ, NVDA, GLD) are currently closed ('CERRADO'). Among crypto assets, none meet our strict trend filter since all are currently classified in a bearish trend below the SMA20. Our existing position in AAPL is currently holding steady at a minor unrealized loss of -0.73%, well within our stop-loss threshold (-1.8% to -2.0%). In accordance with our equity holding patience and strict trend rules, AAPL remains an acceptable hold as it is the only asset currently maintaining a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL is currently in a confirmed uptrend above the SMA20 and its unrealized loss (-0.73%) is well within our stop-loss boundaries. Adhering to equity holding patience and strict trend rules, we continue to hold the position while Wall Street is closed.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL patiently as it remains in an uptrend above the SMA20 and away from the -1.8% stop-loss. Avoid opening any new crypto positions as all available options fail the strict trend filter (trading below SMA20). Keep cash reserves secure ($32.23) and wait for market reopening and cleaner pullback setups in confirmed uptrend assets."
