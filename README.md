### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Equities markets are currently closed (CERRADO) for the weekend, and all tracked equities with the exception of AAPL are either in a downtrend or showing flat momentum. AAPL remains our sole active position, holding strong in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 with a positive PnL approaching take-profit thresholds. Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL) are trading 24/7 but are all currently in confirmed downtrends below their SMA20 lines with negative 1-hour changes or insufficient reversal confirmation (1-hour RSI below 32 or negative 1-hour price action), meaning strict anti-falling-knife rules prevent entering crypto at this time."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 with positive PnL (~2.98%). Following equity holding patience rules, we maintain the position and do not rotate out prematurely while awaiting take-profit criteria (+3.0% to +5.0% or 1h RSI > 72).

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain patience with the AAPL position as per equity holding patience rules, tracking for take-profit criteria (+3.0% to +5.0% gain or 1h RSI exceeding 72). Keep cash reserves protected at $31.84. Do not execute trades on closed equity assets and stay strictly on the sidelines for crypto until confirmed uptrends and positive 1-hour reversal candles materialize."
