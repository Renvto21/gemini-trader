### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Traditional equity and commodity markets (SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, GLD) are currently closed for the weekend/night with frozen prices. Wall Street shows broad bullish momentum post-election, but we adhere to the rule not to trade closed markets. In the crypto sector, which operates 24/7, ETH-USD and BTC-USD remain in confirmed uptrends above their SMA20. Our existing ETH-USD position is performing well with positive 1-hour momentum and healthy RSI."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] ETH-USD** (Confidence: 90%): ETH-USD is in a healthy confirmed uptrend above its SMA20, positive 1-hour momentum, and we are maintaining our single crypto exposure constraint. Holding to let the winner run toward our +3.5% to +5.0% profit target.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Holding the active ETH-USD position as it continues to ride the bullish 24/7 crypto trend above the SMA20. Will monitor for take-profit targets between +3.0% and +5.0% or trim if 1-hour RSI exceeds 72. Maintaining strict stop-loss rules at -2.0% to protect capital. Keeping cash reserves above $4.00 USD."
