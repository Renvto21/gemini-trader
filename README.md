### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Traditional markets remain closed (market status CERRADO), meaning no trades can be executed on equities or ETFs like AAPL, MSFT, or QQQ. In the crypto sector, assets such as ETH-USD, BTC-USD, and SOL-USD are open 24/7 but currently remain in a downtrend (below their SMA20). Although ETH-USD and BTC-USD show positive 1-hour changes and RSI values above 32, our strict quantitative filter prohibits buying any asset that trades below its SMA20 to avoid catching falling knives. Consequently, we maintain a defensive posture with 100% cash allocation until traditional markets reopen or cryptocurrencies establish a confirmed uptrend above their SMA20."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): Traditional markets are closed (CERRADO), and no positions are currently open. We wait for market opening and valid setup conditions.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Holding $39.25 in cash with zero active positions. Traditional markets are closed, and crypto assets are currently below their SMA20. We maintain strict adherence to our trend-following rules: no crypto purchases while below SMA20. When traditional markets reopen, we will monitor AAPL and other high-quality equities for pullback opportunities above their SMA20 with 1-hour RSI >= 32 and positive 1-hour candles."
