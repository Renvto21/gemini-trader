### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street is currently closed for the weekend, leaving stock prices frozen. AAPL remains our sole open position, currently down -0.96%, which is well within our acceptable drawdown threshold and far from our -2.0% circuit breaker stop-loss. Crypto assets (BTC, ETH, SOL) are trading 24/7 but remain in clear downtrends below their respective SMA20 lines with negative 7-day performances, violating our strict trend-following filters. Therefore, no crypto trades will be executed."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and our current position is down only -0.96%, well above our -2.0% stop-loss threshold. Following equity holding patience, we will maintain the position through the market closure.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL through the market closure as equity holding patience dictates. Current PnL is -0.96%, safely above the stop-loss trigger of -1.8% to -2.0%. Target take-profit remains between +3.0% and +5.0%. Avoid all crypto assets due to the ongoing downtrend below SMA20. Re-evaluate potential new pullback entries when traditional markets reopen."
