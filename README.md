### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street equities (AAPL, MSFT, SPY, QQQ, NVDA, GLD) are currently closed with prices frozen, and all monitored assets are currently trading below their SMA20, signaling a broader market correction and bearish trend context. Cryptocurrencies remain open 24/7, but none meet our strict entry filters: either they remain below the SMA20 trend filter or fail to demonstrate a confirmed positive 1-hour reversal bounce ('change_1h_pct' > 0 and 'rsi_1h' >= 32). Current open positions in AAPL and MSFT are experiencing minor pullbacks but have not breached stop-loss thresholds (-1.8% to -2.0%). We adhere to equity holding patience and maintain capital preservation."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): Asset is in a closed market state and within acceptable holding drawdown parameters. Sticking to equity holding patience.
- **[HOLD] MSFT** (Confidence: 100%): Asset is in a closed market state and holding well within the risk tolerance limits prior to stop-loss levels. Maintaining position.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain existing AAPL and MSFT equity positions through the weekend/market closure. Adhere to patience guidelines and avoid premature liquidation unless stop-loss triggers between -1.8% and -2.0% are hit once markets reopen. Monitor crypto markets for potential trend reversals above SMA20 with positive 1-hour momentum, but refrain from taking new trades due to lack of confirmation and anti-correlation constraints. Keep cash reserves secure."
