### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The traditional stock market assets are currently closed ('CERRADO'), with prices frozen. AAPL remains our sole active position, down -0.96%, which is safely above our hard stop-loss limit of -1.8% to -2.0%. In the crypto markets (open 24/7), assets like SOL-USD, ETH-USD, and BTC-USD are trading in bearish trends below their respective SMA20 with negative 1-hour percentage changes, failing our strict trend and reversal confirmation filters. Therefore, no active trades should be executed at this time."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): AAPL is currently in a closed market state. Its PnL is -0.96%, which is well within our acceptable holding range and above our stop-loss threshold. Following equity patience rules, we hold the position until market reopening.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL through the closed market hours as per equity holding patience guidelines. PnL is currently -0.96%; monitor closely once the market reopens for a potential recovery toward our +3.0% to +5.0% take-profit target, or exit if it triggers the -1.8% stop-loss. Keep crypto sidelined due to persistent downtrends and lack of green 1-hour confirmation candles."
