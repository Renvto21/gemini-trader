### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The traditional stock market is currently closed (market status: CERRADO), meaning equity prices are frozen and no execution is possible for AAPL or MSFT. Cryptocurrencies remain open 24/7, but all major crypto assets (SOL, BTC, ETH) are currently in downtrends below their SMA20 with negative 1-hour percentage changes, failing our strict trend and reversal confirmation filters. Our existing equity holdings AAPL and MSFT remain stable; MSFT is slightly up (+0.24%) while AAPL is flat. We maintain patience according to our equity holding rules and will wait for market reopening to evaluate take-profit targets."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and market status is closed. Adhering to the equity holding patience rule while monitoring for take-profit opportunities upon reopening.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain patience on current equity positions AAPL and MSFT. Both are in confirmed uptrends above the SMA20. Monitor closely upon market reopening for take-profit targets between +3.0% and +5.0% or strict stop-loss discipline at -1.8%. Continue avoiding crypto assets due to ongoing downtrends below the SMA20."
