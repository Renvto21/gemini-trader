### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The equity markets remain closed (CERRADO) with prices frozen, meaning no new stock or ETF executions can occur per market hours rules. AAPL is currently being held as it remains in an uptrend above its SMA20 with a current PnL of +0.16% and an hourly RSI of 66.0, approaching our take-profit target zone. Crypto assets (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD) are open 24/7 but are all currently in a bear trend below their SMA20 with negative 1-hour changes, failing our strict trend filter and reversal confirmation triggers. Therefore, no crypto trades will be opened to avoid catching falling knives."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL is maintaining its confirmed uptrend above the SMA20 with a positive PnL (+0.16%). Following equity holding patience guidelines, we give the stock time to play out toward our take-profit target (+3.0% to +5.0%) without premature rotation.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL in its current uptrend above SMA20. Await take-profit target (+3.0% to +5.0% or rsi_1h > 72 with profit >= +2.5%) or maintain strict stop-loss protection at -1.8%. Keep crypto assets sidelined due to downtrends below SMA20 and lack of positive 1-hour reversal confirmation triggers. Reassess equities when Wall Street reopens."
