### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The broader market is experiencing a sharp risk-off pullback, with major indices and crypto assets trading below their SMA20 lines. Cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL are heavily depressed with RSI levels under 20, but without a confirmed 1-hour reversal candle (change_1h_pct > 0 and rsi_1h >= 32), we must avoid catching falling knives. Equities like AAPL, MSFT, and GLD show relative resilience, with MSFT and AAPL holding above their SMA20 trend lines. However, AAPL's 1-hour candle is slightly negative (-0.01%) and GLD's 1-hour RSI is deeply overbought at 90.4, making current entries unfavorable. We maintain high cash discipline and wait for proper trend continuation setups."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 80%): AAPL is in an uptrend above SMA20, but the 1-hour change is slightly negative (-0.01%) and 1-hour RSI is 66.2, lacking an immediate confirmed dip entry. Maintaining cash and waiting for a cleaner reversal trigger.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Preserve cash and maintain strict adherence to trend and reversal filters. Do not enter crypto until 1-hour candles show positive momentum (change_1h_pct > 0) and rsi_1h >= 32. Keep an eye on MSFT and AAPL for high-quality dip buying opportunities if they confirm bounces above their SMA20 support lines."
