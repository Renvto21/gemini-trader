### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street markets are currently closed (CERRADO) with prices frozen, leaving crypto assets as the only active liquidity channel (ABIERTO 24/7). Among crypto assets, both BTC-USD and ETH-USD are in confirmed uptrends (above SMA20), but their 1-hour RSI indicators remain elevated near 76-78. Although BTC-USD shows a tiny positive 1-hour change (+0.02%), the RSI has not cooled down sufficiently to a safer 50-60 range for a textbook pullback entry. Equities like MSFT and AAPL are in uptrends, but since the market is closed, no trading actions can be taken on them at this moment."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] BTC-USD** (Confidence: 80%): BTC-USD is in an uptrend above SMA20, but the 1-hour RSI is still high at 78.2. Await a proper pullback with 1h RSI between 50-60 and a green 1h candle before entering.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintained capital in cash ($38.78). Wall Street is closed. Crypto assets (BTC-USD, ETH-USD) remain strong in uptrends but overbought on the 1-hour timeframe (RSI > 75). Waiting patiently for a deeper pullback where 1h RSI cools down to the 50-60 range accompanied by a positive 1-hour confirmation candle before deploying standard capital ($6.00-$7.00 USD)."
