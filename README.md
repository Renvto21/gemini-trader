### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The traditional stock market is currently closed (CERRADO) with prices frozen, leaving AAPL as our only active equity position. AAPL is showing resilience, holding an uptrend above SMA20 with a PnL of +0.16% and a 1-hour RSI of 66.0, approaching our target threshold. Crypto markets are open (24/7) but remain in a downtrend across BTC, ETH, and SOL (trading below their respective SMA20 values with negative or flat 1-hour changes), requiring us to stay sidelined in crypto to avoid falling knives. Capital preservation and adherence to equity holding patience remain top priorities."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and is currently profitable. Following equity holding patience guidelines during market closure, we maintain our position while awaiting take-profit targets (+3.0% to +5.0% or 1h RSI > 72).

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL through the weekend market closure, monitoring closely for take-profit opportunities if the 1-hour RSI exceeds 72 or PnL hits the +3.0% to +5.0% range once trading resumes. Maintain strict adherence to the -1.8% stop-loss level. Keep all crypto assets sidelined until confirmed uptrends materialize above the SMA20."
