### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The broader market conditions are currently defensive, with most tracked assets sliding below their SMA20 trends amid general weakness. However, AAPL remains a standout outperformer, holding firmly above its SMA20 with an 1-hour RSI reaching 73.4 and a positive return of +1.73%, satisfying our take-profit criteria of +3.0% to +5.0% or RSI > 72 with profit >= +2.5%. MSFT has pulled back slightly to -1.23%, remaining well above our hard stop-loss circuit breaker (-1.8% to -2.0%). Other assets are failing the strict trend filter as they remain below SMA20."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[SELL] AAPL** (Confidence: 95%): AAPL rsi_1h has surpassed 72 (currently 73.4) with a positive return of +1.73%, satisfying our take-profit parameters for locking in gains.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Successfully executed take-profit on AAPL as RSI crossed 72 with solid gains. Continue holding MSFT while closely observing its price action and respecting the strict stop-loss threshold (-1.8% to -2.0%). Refrain from opening any new positions until market breadth improves and more assets confirm an uptrend above their SMA20 with valid reversal triggers."
