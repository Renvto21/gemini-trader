### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street markets remain closed (market_status: CERRADO), meaning traditional equities and commodities cannot be traded during this cycle. AAPL is held in a stable position above its SMA20 trend line with a positive PnL, though trading is locked until market reopening. Crypto markets are open 24/7, but all available crypto assets (BTC, ETH, SOL) are currently trading below their SMA20 trend lines in bearish configurations, failing our strict trend-filter rules. Consequently, no new positions will be opened and cash reserves will be preserved."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): AAPL is currently held with a positive PnL and remains in an uptrend above its SMA20. Because the market is closed (CERRADO), we cannot execute trades; we adhere to equity holding patience until Wall Street reopens.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain the existing AAPL position through the closed market hours as long as it remains above the SMA20 trend. Prepare to execute a profit-taking exit once Wall Street reopens if AAPL approaches our +3.5% to +5.0% target zone or if RSI exceeds 72. Keep all crypto assets sidelined since none satisfy the uptrend requirement above the SMA20. Maintain cash reserves strictly above $4.00."
