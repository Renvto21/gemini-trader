### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The broader market is currently experiencing a synchronized downward pressure, with almost all tracked assets sliding below their SMA20 lines and showing bearish daily momentum. MSFT, our current equity holding, has pulled back to a -1.51% PnL, nearing our hard stop-loss threshold. AAPL is the only asset remaining in a confirmed uptrend (above SMA20) with high RSI, but its 1-hour change is currently slightly negative (-0.1%), failing our reversal confirmation trigger for entry. Cryptocurrencies are deep in bear trends with severely depressed 1-hour RSIs, requiring extreme caution. Capital preservation is paramount."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] MSFT** (Confidence: 85%): MSFT is currently experiencing a minor pullback (-1.51% PnL) but remains well above our hard stop-loss limit of -1.8% to -2.0%. Adhering to equity holding patience rules, we will give the stock time to play out rather than selling prematurely during flat or slightly negative intraday conditions.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain MSFT position while strictly monitoring the -1.8% to -2.0% stop-loss boundary. Do not panic-sell MSFT prematurely under equity holding patience rules unless the stop-loss is breached. Wait for confirmed pullbacks in verified uptrend assets with positive 1-hour candles before deploying remaining cash reserves."
