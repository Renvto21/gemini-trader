### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The portfolio is entirely in cash with $39.25 remaining after cutting MSFT on the stop-loss and taking profits on AAPL. Major equities and asset classes such as SPY, QQQ, NVDA, and GLD are currently in a CERRADO (market closed) state and trending below their SMA20, requiring strict adherence to our capital preservation and trend rules. Cryptocurrencies (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD) are open 24/7, but they are currently exhibiting negative 1-hour percentage changes (e.g., BTC -0.14%, ETH -0.32%, SOL -0.21%), failing our Reversal Confirmation Trigger (change_1h_pct > 0.0). Consequently, no buy or sell actions are warranted at this exact cycle, maintaining our disciplined defensive stance."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] BTC-USD** (Confidence: 100%): No active positions held. Crypto markets are open but currently showing negative 1-hour price changes, failing the Reversal Confirmation Trigger (change_1h_pct > 0.0).

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintained defensive posture with $39.25 in cash. Wall Street assets remain closed and major equities/cryptos are failing the uptrend or reversal confirmation filters. Will continue to monitor crypto 1-hour candles for green reversals (change_1h_pct > 0.0 and rsi_1h >= 32) or wait for Wall Street markets to reopen to scan for quality pullbacks above SMA20."
