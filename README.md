### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The broader equity market remains closed for the weekend, with indices and major individual stocks showing negative momentum and trading below their SMA20 lines. Crypto markets are open 24/7, but assets like ETH-USD, BTC-USD, and SOL-USD are currently experiencing negative 1-hour changes and downward trends, failing to meet our strict reversal confirmation triggers. Existing equity positions in AAPL and MSFT are currently held patiently in accordance with equity holding rules, as they have not hit stop-loss limits."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 80%): Holding AAPL position patiently as per equity holding patience rule. Market is closed and position remains well within acceptable risk limits.
- **[HOLD] MSFT** (Confidence: 80%): Holding MSFT position patiently through weekend market closure as per equity holding patience rule.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain current AAPL and MSFT equity positions through the weekend. Do not execute any new trades as equities are closed and crypto assets lack positive 1-hour momentum confirmation above the SMA20. Continue monitoring for trend reclaims and positive 1-hour price action triggers when markets reopen."
