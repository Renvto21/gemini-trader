### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The market shows a mixed environment where most broader indices and commodities remain below their SMA20 (bearish trend), preventing new long entries per our strict rules. However, our current equity holdings, AAPL and MSFT, are both in confirmed uptrends (above SMA20) and performing steadily. MSFT has a small profit of +0.33%, while AAPL is virtually flat at -0.06% after a multi-day holding period. Per our equity holding patience rule, we will maintain both positions as they have not hit stop-loss or take-profit thresholds. Cash reserves remain robust at $25.75."

**Cycle Actions:**
- *No changes this cycle (HOLD)*

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain current positions in AAPL and MSFT. Monitor for take-profit targets (+3.0% to +5.0%) or stop-loss triggers (-1.8% to -2.0%). Keep observing the watchlist for high-quality assets reclaiming their SMA20 before considering new deployments from our cash reserves."
