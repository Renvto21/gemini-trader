### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall market continues to exhibit broad weakness, with major equity indices and cryptocurrencies trading below their respective 20-day simple moving averages (SMA20). Most assets are in a bearish trend, and key equities are currently closed. AAPL remains our sole active equity position, holding steady with a +0.5% gain while maintaining its position above the SMA20 uptrend filter. Cryptocurrencies are open 24/7, but none currently meet our strict entry filters (e.g., positive 1-hour price change combined with being above SMA20), keeping us sidelined on new risk. Capital preservation and adherence to equity holding patience remain top priorities."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL is maintaining its uptrend above the SMA20 and is currently up +0.5%. Per equity holding patience rules, we do not sell flat positions prematurely and will let the trade play out toward our +3.0% to +5.0% take-profit target or down to the strict -1.8% stop-loss.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL while monitoring for our take-profit target of +3.0% to +5.0% (around $357 to $364) or stop-loss trigger at -1.8%. Avoid opening new positions in closed equities or in crypto assets due to ongoing downtrends and lack of clean 1-hour green candle confirmation. Maintain strict adherence to risk rules and preserve cash reserves."
