### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street equities and commodities are currently closed (CERRADO), leaving prices frozen. AAPL remains our sole active position, trading in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 with a mild positive return (+0.16%) and a 1-hour RSI of 66.0, approaching our take-profit zone (+3% to +5% gain or rsi_1h > 72). Cryptocurrencies remain open 24/7, but all major tokens (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD) are in a bearish trend below their SMA20 with negative 1-hour changes, failing our strict trend and reversal filters. Therefore, no crypto trades are permitted."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 85%): AAPL is currently in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and showing positive momentum. Following equity holding patience guidelines, we hold the position as it has not reached our take-profit target (+3.0% to +5.0%) or stop-loss limit (-1.8%), and Wall Street markets are closed.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL as it maintains its uptrend above the SMA20 line. Monitor AAPL closely for take-profit criteria (+3.0% to +5.0% gain or 1-hour RSI above 72) or a breach of the strict stop-loss threshold (-1.8% to -2.0%). Keep all crypto assets sidelined due to bearish trends below the SMA20. Maintain cash reserves above $4.00 USD and wait for market reopening or qualified equity pullbacks."
