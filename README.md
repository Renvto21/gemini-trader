### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The overall macro sentiment shows major equities and alternative assets experiencing downward pressure, with SPY, QQQ, NVDA, and GLD all trading below their SMA20 trend lines and marked as closed. AAPL remains our sole active equity position, currently closed and showing resilience with a minor PnL of -0.73%, well within our acceptable drawdown parameters under equity holding patience rules. In the crypto markets, assets like BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and SOL-USD are open 24/7, but BTC-USD and SOL-USD remain in a bearish trend below their SMA20, while ETH-USD is also below its SMA20. Strict trend filters dictate we avoid catching falling knives or opening long crypto positions without a confirmed uptrend above the SMA20."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 80%): AAPL remains in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and satisfies our equity holding patience rules. The position's current PnL of -0.73% is well within our stop-loss threshold, so we continue holding to let the trade play out.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Continue holding AAPL in accordance with equity holding patience rules, as it is above the SMA20 and unaffected by short-term fluctuations, targeting a profit objective of +3% to +5% while maintaining the hard stop-loss at -2.0%. Avoid opening any new cryptocurrency positions until an asset establishes a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 and triggers our positive 1H momentum rules. Maintain cash reserves above $4.00 USD."
