### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The traditional stock market is closed (market status 'CERRADO') for the weekend/holiday session, meaning equities like AAPL, SPY, QQQ, NVDA, and MSFT cannot be traded at this time. Most equities remain under pressure below their SMA20 trends, with AAPL standing out as the sole major asset holding its bullish trend above the SMA20 line. Cryptocurrencies are open 24/7, but BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and SOL-USD are currently trading in bearish trends below their respective SMA20 lines and lack a confirmed positive 1-hour candle bounce ('change_1h_pct' is negative), violating our reversal confirmation triggers."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 90%): AAPL remains in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20 filter. Following the equity holding patience rule, we continue to hold the position as it fluctuates near its entry price, avoiding premature rotation.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain the current AAPL equity position as it remains above its SMA20 filter and adheres to the equity holding patience rule despite being flat. Target recovery for AAPL is near $360.00, keeping a tight stop-loss near $340.00 (-1.8% to -2.0%). Cash reserves are safely maintained at $32.23. For upcoming crypto cycles, wait for assets to reclaim their SMA20 trend lines and show confirmed positive 1-hour candles before deploying capital."
