### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "The broad market is currently closed for the weekend, and risk sentiment remains suppressed with key equities and crypto assets trading below their respective SMA20 thresholds in a general corrective trend. All major assets, including AAPL and MSFT held in the portfolio, show negative 1-hour changes and neutral-to-low RSI readings while markets are closed. Cryptocurrencies like SOL-USD, BTC-USD, and ETH-USD fail to meet the strict entry filters, lacking both a confirmed uptrend above the SMA20 and a positive 1-hour momentum bounce. Capital preservation is prioritized while awaiting the reopening of traditional equity markets."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 100%): Asset is currently closed for the weekend. Per equity holding patience rules, do not rotate or sell an equity position just because it has been flat or slightly negative; hold until market reopening unless the stop-loss limit is breached.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain existing AAPL and MSFT equity positions through the weekend closure, respecting the strict -2.0% stop-loss circuit breaker. Do not execute trades on closed equity markets. For crypto assets, avoid entry since none satisfy the trend filter (above SMA20) combined with a positive 1-hour momentum trigger. Preserve cash reserves above $4.00 USD and wait for market reopening."
