### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "Wall Street markets remain closed, keeping traditional equities and ETFs frozen while cryptocurrencies trade 24/7. Major crypto assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL are currently exhibiting bearish trends below their respective SMA20 lines, failing our strict trend and momentum filters. Meanwhile, our open equity position in AAPL is behaving normally, remaining above its SMA20 despite a mild intraday pullback. We maintain patience on AAPL in accordance with equity holding rules and will wait for traditional markets to reopen before evaluating new opportunities in MSFT or GLD."

**Cycle Actions:**
- **[HOLD] AAPL** (Confidence: 80%): AAPL is in a confirmed uptrend above its SMA20. Per equity holding patience rules, we do not rotate out of flat or mildly negative equity positions simply due to short-term noise while traditional markets are closed.

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Holding AAPL position patiently. Traditional markets are closed, so no stock actions can be taken. Crypto markets lack confirmed upward momentum triggers with positive 1-hour changes and safe RSI levels, preventing any new crypto buys. Will monitor MSFT and GLD for pullback entry opportunities when traditional market hours resume."
