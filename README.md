### 🧠 Latest Gemini Market Analysis (Current Cycle)

> "All equity markets and asset classes, including our current holdings AAPL, MSFT, and GLD, are currently closed with prices frozen. Furthermore, equities and crypto assets across the board are displaying bearish trends below their respective SMA20 lines with negative 1-hour momentum, preventing any immediate buying opportunities under our strict trend-following filters. Our existing positions are safely above stop-loss thresholds (-1.8% to -2.0%), and per equity holding patience rules, we will hold them through the weekend."

**Cycle Actions:**
- *No changes this cycle (HOLD)*

### 📝 Operational Memory & Journal (Next Cycles)

> "Maintain existing positions AAPL, MSFT, and GLD as they have not breached stop-loss levels (-1.8%). Crypto markets remain open 24/7, but none meet our strict breakout criteria (above SMA20 with positive 1-hour candles). Wait for traditional market open and confirmed uptrend reclaims before deploying any additional capital from our $18.14 cash reserves."
